Models/textures by Carbon Games http://carbongames.com
Psd file has layers to make your own custom colors--a few are saved off as png files.
Bones are setup for what our engine/game needs, they aren't meant to work for everyone as-is.

Feel free to use and modify, please give credit if used! No restriction on commercial or private use, just don't claim you made them.

Touch controllers obviously copyright Oculus/Facebook.

These models were created from pre-production hardware so are plenty close but not likely to be exact. We can "touch" the controllers together and they match the real world, so that's close enough for us. Button sizes and locations were also tweaked for useability and readability when ingame. You could tweak it to make it more accurate, but users will have a hard time reading the button labels.

Polygon count and texture size are optimized for bang for your buck. These are not million poly models--they are what we think is "enough" considering the current resolution of the Rift while having a minimal performance impact.

Enjoy!
