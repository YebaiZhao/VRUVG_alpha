I build and zip my files virus free, but you should alway be careful upon EXE files and do your virus scan.

## Background

What you have here is my Unity game build developed for a user study called User Visual Guidance in VR, VRUVG for short.

## Hardware/Software Requirments

Your computer should have the ability to run Oculus or other VR system before you try it.

I build this on Unity 2017.4.0f1, it has only been tested on Windows 10 with Oculus. It has not been tested on Vive or MacOS. You need to have at least two controllers to interact in the game.
